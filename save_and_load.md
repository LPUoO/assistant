## Saving and loaging workflows
Workflows can be saved as groovy scripts. These scripts allow you to re-open an earlier created workflow and continue to
work on it. Just save the script to disc and re-open it with Fijis script editor.

These groovy scripts are not meant to be edited. If you want to create scripts for image analysis scripts for automation,
which can be edited, consult the [Export workflows as ImageJ Script](https://clij.github.io/assistant/macro_export) section.
